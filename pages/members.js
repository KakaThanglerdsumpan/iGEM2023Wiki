                  Thailand-RIS is making its third appearance at iGEM! With a growing and more diverse team, we have been working hard to build capacity across grade levels and embrace the new and adjusted aspects of the competition. I am continually impressed with the level of independence that our team members demonstrate to execute such a high level project and to work with community members both in and outside of RIS. My main role as adviser is to support the team leaders with their plans, offer guidance during the ups and downs and to ensure smooth and safe travel to the Jamboree. As with our previous two teams, we have set our sights high but are focused primarily on learning from this experience and seeing where we can make an impact in the community. When I am not working with the team, I can be found teaching Biology, coordinating our IB Diploma Program and spending time with my family.

                  Halo! My name is Adhit, I am a postdoc researcher from Indonesia, and I am currently working at Lab 708, the Center of Excellence in Molecular Crops, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. I have been so into plant biology since I was elementary school. Back then, I was doing experiments on the effects of salt on the mung bean, and I cannot believe that this plant once again became one of my specimens in this postdoctoral project! I started my journey at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia, where I majored in biology for my BSc, and I was a member of the Plant Science and Biotechnology research group. Then I continued for MSc at Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia, where I focused on plant breeding and genetics. After that, I took an odd detour where I studied biomechanics and biomimetics for my PhD in Åbo Akademi University, Finland, and here, I learned so much working with molecular modelling. In Indonesia, I was once a cram school biology teacher for my freelance job, where I love to share my molecular biology enthusiasm to my students, and I am also one of the advisory boards of Synthetic Biology Indonesia (Synbio ID). I love working with plant bioinformatics for multi-omics analysis, because this way, I can dive into plant&apos;s awesome molecular machinery and learn something new. For Thailand-RIS, I am happy to serve as the advisor to Ms. Nicole Sabet and enjoy teaching everyone with the bioinformatics analysis (dry lab).

Since then, he has been working as a postdoctoral fellow. His research interests engage in applying multi-omics approaches (genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, hormonome, and interactome) to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying post-harvest ripening of climacteric fruit and plant-bacteria interactions for enhancing biotic/abiotic stress tolerance.

At the age of fourteen, while her house was being renovated, she saw chemical names that she had learnt in class on labels on paint buckets. She then realized that science is all around us, and she knew that she wanted to study science from then on. Every time she conducts research, the excitement of discovery and discussion has never left her. She is interested in molecular mechanisms of floral development and carotenoid metabolism, specifically the study of diversity and evolution.
