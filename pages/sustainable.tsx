<span className="text-left text-BGreen">Agriculture and access to food are major influencing factors behind many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Security and replenishment within the food supply is essential not only to human health but to the global economy. This is especially true in Texas, with farms comprising 74% of the state's land (USDA, 2019). Texas hosts a diverse variety of farmers, including small, family-owned farms as primary producers alongside corporate and state owned farms. As Texas has stagnated or fell behind in the achievement of the SDGs, we believe it is crucial for synthetic biologists possess the unique ability to bridge these gaps through scientific innovation. Our crop protection method has the possibility of benefitting producers at every level while also contributing to relevant SDGs.</span>

<h6>The Problem</h6>
<h3> Around <span className='font-bold'>30% </span>of the global food supply is <span className='font-bold'>lost or wasted annually</span>, and one third of this waste occurs during <span className='font-bold'>agricultural production </span>(FAO, 2023). While crop loss during production can be due to a variety of factors, bacterial plant pathogens can play a significant role. These pathogens can <span className='font-bold'>destroy entire crops yields</span>, which is especially devastating for small farmers that rely on their production for food. <span className='font-bold'> Rural Texans </span>are especially vulnerable to food insecurity as they often lack access to food, increasing reliance on small-scale farming (Feeding Texas, 2023). Lessening loss of food in agriculture is not only essential to achieving sustainability but to improving the lives of millions of Texans.</h3>
<h6>Project Impact</h6>
<h3>Our project addresses the need to <span className='font-bold'>prevent food loss</span> while working in <span className='font-bold'> harmony with nature</span>. Using native plant symbionts as chassis organisms for our microcin secretion system would allow protection to come from the <span className='font-bold'> local plant microbiome</span> rather than applied chemicals. This system has the potential to save large amounts of crops, which can make a large difference for small and large farms alike. Our system could also lessen reliance on pesticides by providing a <span className='font-bold'>sustainable, self-replicating alternative</span>. This would allow small farmers to spend less on unsustainable chemicals, expensive screening equipment, and labor intensive practices.</h3>
<h6>Stakeholder Feedback:</h6>
<h3 className='underline'>Dr. Mercedes Roca</h3>
<h3>One key stakeholder we spoke with was Dr. Mercedes Roca, a plant pathologist who serves as the Executive Director of Bioscience Think Tank and Senior Fellow of the Institute on Science for Global Policy. We specifically discussed topics such as feeding the global population and the contemporary issues facing agriculture in Texas. Dr. Roca highlighted that about <span className='font-bold'>1.3% of Texans grow their food directly, </span> and that the contribution and needs of agricultural producers can often go underrecognized by urban populations. Her insight helped us consider how our project could better serve our local community and ensure access to food. We specifically used her feedback to consider how <span className='font-bold'>bacterial pathogens can disproportionately affect small farms </span>and the communities that rely on them.</h3>

<h6>The Problem</h6>
<h3>According to the International Labour Organization, about <span className='font-bold'>65% of global farmland is operated by large-scale farmers</span>, meaning that industrial agriculture accounts for the majority of farms (FAO, 2014). Current methods of crop protection within industrial agriculture can be expensive, labor intensive, and harmful to the environment. For instance, large-scale farms currently rely on large x-ray machines to identify center rot due to Pantoea. This technology is too expensive for smaller farms, which must use other preventative measures to mitigate the effects of bacterial pathogens, as they cannot easily identify the rot post-harvest. However, the pesticides used to prevent the spread of bacterial pathogens have a highly negative impact on the sustainability of farm land. With agriculture only becoming <span className='font-bold'>more industrialized </span>each year, it is essential to foster <span className='font-bold'>inclusive and sustainable innovations </span> that positively impact the planet.
</h3>
<h6>Project Impact</h6>
<h3>Our project <span className='font-bold'>builds upon crop protection methods </span>currently being used in industrial agriculture while also <span className='font-bold'>introducing innovation</span>. Many farmers implement biocontrols, which are typically organisms that naturally attack a pest or bacteria. However, our approach adds to this concept by allowing farmers to <span className='font-bold'>target bacterial pathogens </span> that may not have a natural biocontrol. This innovation would allow farmers to easily target a broad range of pathogens while using bacteria already found on their crops. This concept could also foster the further innovation of natural crop protection within industrial agriculture, further promoting sustainable industry.
</h3>
<h6>Stakeholder Feedback</h6>
<h3 className='underline'>Dr. Lindsey du Toit</h3>
<h3>Dr. du Toit is a plant pathologist and a project coordinator for Stop the Rot, a USDA initiative focused on combating onion bacterial diseases. Her experience working directly with agricultural producers to address field-needs provided us with valuable information regarding the sustainability of our project. Specifically, she <span className='font-bold'>highlighted the need for biocontrols </span> and <span className='font-bold'>innovation </span> within the field of agriculture. Dr. du Toit validated our approach to a sustainable solution while also educating us on how microcins could mitigate onion rot.

<h6>The Problem</h6>
<h3>Between 2001 and 2016, the American Farmland trust estimated Texas lost around <span className='font-bold'>1.3 million acres of farmland to development </span> (Sallet, 2021). This loss of farmland is projected to have massive impacts on the economy, environment, and the livelihood of thousands of Texans. Rapid urbanization especially threatens areas with mostly <span className='font-bold'>small family-owned farms</span>, as these farms are disproportionately susceptible to the devastating impacts of pathogens and rising costs of chemicals and production goods. These farms are more likely to be acquired by large companies, leading to loss of farmland and increasing urbanization. <span className='font-bold'>Providing farmers with the ability to protect their crops and land is crucial to sustainable urban development in Texas</span>.</h3>
<h6>Project Impact:</h6>
<h3>Protection from harmful bacterial plant pathogens provides farmers with security. Our microcin secretion system could be customized to attack a broad range of pathogens, <span className='font-bold'>allowing farmers to maintain production in the face of different infections</span>. Additionally, using our system could be financially beneficial to farmers. Not only would it save money in crop losses, but protecting plants from pathogens could <span className='font-bold'>reduce reliance expensive equipmentused to evaluate crops for infection</span>. Our system would ultimately ensure <span className='font-bold'>farmland remains in the hands of farmers </span> and urbanization can proceed at a responsible pace.</h3>

<h6>The Problem:</h6>
<h3>Many contemporary techniques used to protect crops can contribute to agricultural production methods. Farmers often use pesticides to prevent insect vectors from spreading bacterial pathogens to plants, but many reports have shown these chemicals are <span className='font-bold'>harmful to the environment</span>. Expensive machinery can also be used to screen crops for infection, which increases costs and energy consumption. These practices are part of the current cycle of unsustainable agricultural production and promote reliance on unsustainable crop protect methods. Sustainable, preventative measures are needed to ensure a sustainable cycle of consumption and production in agriculture.</h3>

<h6>Project Impact</h6>
<h3>Many industries <span className='font-bold'>have already begun using bacteria </span> to create products that would otherwise require high amounts of energy (McAlpine, 2014). Moreover, bacterial biocontrols have also risen as <span className='font-bold'>sustainable alternatives to pesticides </span> in recent years (Bonaterra et al., 2022). Building upon these recent advancements, bacterial microcin production is one possible way to offset energy and carbon emissions spent on the chemicals used to protect crops. Additionally, using a modular system to attack a variety of pathogens could save researchers time and money searching for new protection methods.
</h3>
<h6>Stakeholder Feedback:</h6>
<h3 className='underline'>Rising Sun Vineyard</h3>
<h3>One of the key stakeholders we spoke to regarding this SDG was Rising Sun Vineyard, a local vineyard operation in Bastrop County, Texas. During our excursion we discussed their struggles with Pierce’s Disease, a plant pathogen caused by Xyllela fastidiosa. As the disease is spread to grapes through thrips, an insect vector, the farmers focused on preventing infection through pesticides. Preventing crop infection was crucial as <span className='font-bold'>mass loss of the harvest is highly likely to occur post-infection</span>. When discussing the potential downsides of these current methods, the farmers’ acknowledged concerns about the sustainability and environmental impacts of pesticides, such as their hesitance to expose the surrounding environment to the chemical components of pesticides. The farmers responded <span className='font-bold'>positively to the idea of using engineered bacterial symbionts as an alternative to pesticides </span> and as a potential treatment for Pierce’s Disease.
</h3>
<h6>Potential Negative Impacts:</h6>
<h3>We are aware of the inherent risks of using novel antimicrobial agents in agriculture. While the current studies involving microcins do not indicate they are harmful to human, animal, or insect health, the impact of microcins must still be thoroughly characterized prior to use. If this is not done, our project could potentially negatively impact SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 15: Life on Land. It is also important to select the appropriate bacteria as a chassis for our system. We should ensure the bacteria used will not be harmful to the plant or plant microbiome. Additionally, we will carefully consider the plants and animals that interact with this plant and how the bacteria could possibly affect them. Trials specific to the plant and pathogen in question would likely have to be conducted before full deployment of the system.</h3>
