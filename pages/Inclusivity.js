                            <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019 and 2022, RIS assembled teams of ten or fewer interested friends to compete in iGEM. In contrast, iGEM 2023 was opened up to the entirety of our high school in a formal selection process. This led to a larger team roster composed of more diverse grade levels, nationalities, and focused interests, ranging from illustration and communication to biology and coding. To satisfy iGEM criteria, it is crucial that we tap into local infrastructure for both our lab and human practices teams. Although we have the strength of being a largely Thai-knowledgeable team, we also have a growing contingent of non-Thai members who have been able to make strong contributions without Thai language skills. The adult contingent of our team and attributions is somewhat similar in diversity, which allows for strong advising in multiple aspects of the program.
                            </p>  
                                <br/>
                            <p>  
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only 6 teams participating from South East Asia this year, and out of those 6 teams, we are the only high school team, thus making us an embodiment of inclusivity for both South East Asians and young adults in synthetic biology. Moreover, most  teams in the SEA region — both at the high school and collegiate level — do not have the capacity or funds to travel to the world stage for an expensive and time consuming competition such as iGEM. The fact that we are the only high school team that is representing the SEA region in iGEM 2023 is an incredible honor and privilege, but it also makes our team responsible for the representation of our cultures in order to reflect the experiences of the 688 million people in SEA.
                            </p>
                                <br/>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motto of iGEM is &apos;&apos; Local People Solving Local Problems,&apos;&apos; and yet for the overwhelmingly underrepresented SEA, there are no hands to help in solving local issues with synthetic biology. According to the General Survey conducted by the team, 68.8% of participants think that GMOs are harmful to the environment and that they produce negative long term effects. These results also mimic the misunderstandings about synthetic biological products such as GMOs, which have only been growing over hundreds of years in this area of the world. This is why the Thailand-RIS team pursues inclusivity and awareness, aiming to bring understanding to everyone even when this part of the world considers these topics taboo.

                <h1 id="header2"><b>Including the general public</b></h1>
                            <p>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thailand-RIS Human Practices&apos; Team sent out the General Survey to gauge the general public&apos;s opinion on GMOs. The survey had options for a broad range of ages (teenagers - senior citizens) and was available in both Thai and English. This allowed for more responses from a wider audience, further establishing the idea of inclusivity, as our team encouraged both Thai and non-Thai citizens residing in Thailand to be a part of our project. The survey also gave a voice to a much wider community than would have been possible had our team met physically, thus enhancing the data collected. This survey spoke to our team’s inclusivity as anyone who came across the General Survey could easily access and fill it out.
                            </p>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in the Chanthaburi Community Outreach, the farmers and stakeholders whom we were presenting to mainly spoke Thai, and some could not understand English at all. Knowing this, our team took the necessary measures to ensure that we were being inclusive to our listeners. So, we translated our project description and content and verbally communicated in Thai. Not only were we aware of including our listeners, but by stating our project in a different language that our listeners can understand, we are broadening the field of synthetic biology to more societies and our local communities.
                            </p>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project addressed multiple UN SDGs, namely SDG #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and SDG #12: Responsible Consumption and Production. GMOs are involved in the work of farm laborers and farm owners, and can influence their incomes and livelihoods. Our project strives to lessen the struggles of farming within local communities by lowering plant stresses. GMOs grow more efficiently and do not require as many resources, which benefits everyone and promotes sustainability while decreasing food waste for communities. With synthetic biology, producers will be able to more easily grow durian plants despite increasing stressors due to climate change. Likewise, consumers will be able to enjoy stronger and therefore more available plants with cheaper prices.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synthetic biology aids in decreasing inequality and the gaps that come with it in Thailand because it allows for easier farming and production of various crops. This can lower prices of crop goods and increase affordability, allowing more individuals the ability to access and purchase a diverse range of crops and goods that only the privileged currently access. This would also be beneficial for the farmers as they would reduce their losses and as a result better support their families.

                            <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team&apos;s Chanthaburi Community Outreach was another way in which inclusivity was demonstrated in our project, as the activities informed the farming community about GMOs and its implications in a world of Western science. Our interactions with the local community allowed us to speak about issues that are not critically discussed in local curricula and therefore difficult to bring up in daily conversations. Since deeper exchanges surrounding GMOs are generally limited within the English language and corresponding literature or reserved for academic and political discourse, our Thai language contributions allowed the farmers and farm laborers to better understand the advantages and risks of genetic engineering. Modern science stemmed from Western Europe, and as a result, has restricted science to English related languages. Our Thai presentations and activities have gone against this trend and shed light on important and relevant topics surrounding GMOs for the farming community. It also enabled us to appreciate more the potential opportunities and challenges of applying our work to real crops. This opened up discussions about the future of synthetic biology and where it can bring Thailand economically as a hub of food security in the South East Asian region.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the Elementary School Workshop, we were informed that there were several fourth grade students with weaker English learning skills who may need extra support. These students were in English Language Development (ELD) and the teachers informed us that if the instructions or choices were not visual, they may not be able to participate to the fullest in the activity. Accordingly, the activities that were organized were specifically tailored for the engagement of <i>all</i> fourth graders, regardless of their English level.  For example, in the plasmid activity, we focused heavily on using symbols instead of words so that kids with weaker English proficiencies would have an easier time recognizing traits for the assignment. This means our work is easily transferable outside of RIS to a local public school or even easily borrowed by other teams for their own language environments, thus enhancing inclusivity. For the comic, the story plotline was relatively easy to follow, and the speech bubbles that we provided gave the students room to add their own creative flairs to the comic. This approach enabled diverse learners to understand our project better and frame it to their own interpretations.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to focus on 4th grade students at RIS as an audience for this workshop, which included spreading awareness of the climate concerns that currently affect agriculture in Thailand. Examples of these impacts include floods and droughts, which damage crops and the livelihoods of suppliers and consumers alike. In this era of climate change, understanding these global issues early is crucial for developing continued awareness that both knowledge  <i>and</i> collaboration are needed to address global issues of sustainable consumption.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our interactive mini-info session spoke to global warming and its effects on Thailand, connecting the issue to our project&apos;s goal of reducing plant stress. The presentation was highly visual with many quiz-style questions in order to facilitate and check for understanding. Additionally, we led the 4th graders through two fun activities: 1. a plasmid-based design and 2. a comic strip to color, annotate, and freely interpret. 
                            </p>

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasmid activity allowed students to create their own &apos;&apos;dream tomato&apos;&apos; by customizing various traits such as color, shape, leaves, and an extra characteristic. This extra trait was our way of encouraging the 4th graders to add their own flair to their tomatoes. Not only did this activity promote how science can be fun, but it also drew awareness to the fact that science can help people alter crops based on their desired needs. The underlying message behind this activity was both innovative and educational.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comic strip we created had a storyline based on our project — it told the story of a durian becoming stronger and more stress resistant after being agroinfiltrated with the agrobacterium we synthesized. The comic strip featured text bubbles so that the 4th graders could add their own dialogue and interpretations of the story, which also had an underlying message that they could play a part in the world of synthetic biology. It allows students to become more immersed in the story of increasing plant resistance. This component of the comic strip was developed in collaboration with the 4th grade teachers who provided advice on what interactive and hands-on activities could look like at a 4th grade level. The text bubbles allowed for every comic strip to have its own unique story and idea, which hopefully introduced everyone to the concept of how science can be used in the real world.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workshop was very successful and engaging for both the 4th graders and our team. The students demonstrated genuine interest, and were eager to ask thought-provoking questions. During the workshop, we felt their attention, curiosity, and enthusiasm shine through. Our team felt extremely proud of the fact that we were able to provide an educational and interactive learning environment while still maintaining a creative space for the 4th graders. We were also grateful for the teachers who took the time to facilitate this workshop and make it a reality. After the workshop, we received a heartwarming message from Ms Mina Park, one of the 4th grade science teachers who assisted our team in ensuring that the workshop content was appropriate for 4th graders.

We also grew as a team, learning to strengthen our cooperation and communication skills. Moreover, with the help of our workshop, the 4th graders are now aware that they can contribute to higher level sciences even when they are still young. We have enabled them to become passionate and interested in biology, and demonstrated to them that they don&apos;t need to be a scientist or a professional to play a part in the changes that science can bring. By exposing the students to fun activities that act as a vessel of creativity and agency, we have contributed to raising the next generation of children living in Thailand to be more educated in synthetic biology.
