                <p>The synthesis of the mitochondrial <i>Durio zibethinus</i> Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase (mDzGCL) protein used in this project was done through replacing the chloroplast transit peptide found in <i>Durio zibethinus</i> Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase (DzGCL) with a mitochondrial transit peptide found in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).</p>

                    <h2>Plant and Gene Selection</h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DzGCL was selected as the ideal candidate GCL protein for relocalization due to its remarkable attributes observed in <i>D. zibethinus </i>. This unique plant species displays significantly elevated levels of glutathione (GSH)<sup>[1]</sup> in its ripe fruit pulp much higher than that in other plants<sup>[2]</sup>. This distinct characteristic suggests the DzGCL as a candidate enzyme with possibly high activity. GCL serves as the rate limiting enzyme in the production of GSH, the primary antioxidant. 
                            <br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A. thaliana</i>  SDH, on the other hand, served as our model for obtaining the mitochondrial transit peptide. A. thaliana was chosen as our model plant due to its well-established status in plant biology research, with its genetic characteristics widely studied and understood<sup>[3]</sup>. Furthermore, given that SDH is a fundamental component within the mitochondrial electron transport chain, the team hypothesized that it must contain a mitochondrial transit peptide facilitating its localization to the mitochondria. Through literature review, this hypothesis was found to be true as Figueroa <i>et al</i>. successfully identified the transit peptide in <i>A. thaliana</i> SDH and validated its role in localizing SDH to the mitochondria in 2001<sup>[4]</sup>.

                    <h2>Gene Modification</h2>
                        <p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step was to identify the amino acid sequence of DzGCL from the NCBI database (accession number: XP_022738907.1). After obtaining the amino acid sequence, the natural chloroplast transit peptide of DzGCL must be predicted in order to be deleted and replaced accordingly. The chloroplast transit peptide within DzGCL was predicted through the TargetP-2.0 software<sup>[5]</sup>(Fig. 1), utilizing its deep learning algorithm trained on a diverse dataset of biological sequences, including known chloroplast transit peptides,  to recognize indicative features of sorting signals<sup>[6]</sup>.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deleting the chloroplast transit peptide from DzGCL, the next step was to identify the amino acid sequence for <i>A. thaliana</i> SDH from NCBI database (accession number: CAC19855.1), in which the mitochondria transit peptide has already been identified as amino acids positions 1 to 29 by Figueroa <i>et al</i>.<sup>[4]</sup>. The identified mitochondrial transit peptide was subsequently copied and inserted into the DzGCL in the stead of the deleted chloroplast transit peptide, yielding mDzGCL as shown in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequences were finally translated back to nucleotides to obtain <i>mDzGCL</i> gene utilized in the plasmid.

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After acquiring mDzGCL, <i>in silico</i> subcellular localization prediction of the modified GCL was performed through deep learning using TargetP-2.0 to confirm the success of the modification in producing a mitochondrial GCL. As shown in the table in Fig. 4, it was predicted that mDzGCL will localize in the mitochondria with a 92.25% probability that is transit peptide is mitochondrial, confirming the success of the modification in relocalizing the DzGCL to the mitochondria. </p>

                    <h2>Function</h2>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the localization of the mDzGCL to be mitochondria, the next step was to confirm that the enzymatic functions of the modified GCL (mDzGCL) was not disturbed by the modification of the transit peptide and is still the same as that of the unmodified GCL (DzGCL).
                        <br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the FASTA sequences of the chloroplastic DzGCL and the mitochondrial mDzGCL, the first thing done was acquiring predictions of their maps through the HMMER program <sup>7</sup>, HMMScan, which utilizes the hidden Markov model and statistical analyses to find matches in the sequence with known functional domain sequences in a database. In this case, the Pfam protein database<sup>8</sup> was used. The maps outputted by HMMScan of DzGCL and mDzGCL are displayed in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. Both figures show that HMMScan was able to identify the signature glutamate-cysteine ligase family 2 functional domain of a GCL represented by the brown section in the maps. Furthermore, the length of the functional domains calculated by finding the difference in the end and the start amino acid positions were found to be the same. Thus, the modifications in the mDzGCL were shown to have not disturbed the functional domain of GCL.

To further verify the integrity of the enzymatic function of GCL in mDzGCL, 3D structures of DzGCL and mDzGCL were predicted using AlphaFold2, a software that combines empirical knowledge on protein structure with a deep-learning algorithm, leveraging evolutionary data through multiple-sequence alignment. This approach often yields protein models of comparable accuracy to experimentally determined structures<sup>9, 10</sup>. The predictions obtained from AlphaFold2 were then visualized in PyMOL v2.5.5 (by Schr√∂dinger) for analysis. Shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the 3D structures of DzGCL and mDzGCL, respectively, are observably similar except for the tail, in which the difference is due to modifications in the N-terminal when replacing the chloroplast transit peptide in mDzGCL with mitochondrial one. The similarity between the two 3D structures is better displayed in Fig. 8, where the DzGCL (green) and mDzGCL (red) are overlaid, and a complete overlap is observable. Therefore, since the structure of the modified GCL (mDzGCL) closely resembles that of the unmodified GCL (DzGCL), the enzymatic function should also remain approximately the same.
