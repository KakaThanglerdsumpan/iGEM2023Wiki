    <p>Thailand is heavily dependent on its agricultural industry. An issue that Thai farmers often face is the degradation of their crop harvest as a result of extreme environmental conditions that cause stress to their plants—posing a threat to their livelihoods and causing adverse economic consequences. The Thailand-RIS team aims to alleviate this issue by modifying the Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) gene which plays an important role in stress response via regulating the production of Glutathione (GSH). Thailand-RIS seeks to remove Chloroplast transit peptides and replace them with a Mitochondrial transit sequence in order to bypass the transport process and enable the production of GSH directly in the Mitochondria. Since the Mitochondria is the primary site of reactive oxygen species production, this modification holds the potential to make the production of GCL more efficient and abundant; thus increasing a plant’s resistance to stress. Imagine cooking food in the kitchen and the bedroom, would it be faster for you to cook a meal in the kitchen or the bedroom? Just like how it would be more efficient to cook in the kitchen since the ingredients and tools are already available, it is faster for plants to produce GSH directly in the Mitochondria (done through changing GCL’s transit peptide from a cytosol one to a Mitochondrial one) since oxidative reductive species helps the production of GSH.</p>

    As a result of Climate change, Thailand has been susceptible to frequent weather changes such as droughts, flooding, and extreme heat. These weather conditions are estimated to cost the Thai economy a total of 36 million baht in 2023 alone. As climate change rapidly worsens, Thailand-RIS aims to reduce its effects on the Thai economy and Thai agricultural workers through reducing the stress response of plants. By successfully making the stress response mechanism faster, plants will be less susceptible to different factors that may trigger stress responses.
